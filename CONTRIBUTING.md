# Participiant: How to Contribute

1. **Setup Your Codebase**:
   - **Fork** the repository (acmpesuecc/mutual-funds-manager) to your GitHub account
   - **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine using [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git) (make sure it's installed)

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:your-username/repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**:
   After cloning and setting up your branch, make the necessary changes to the code in your IDE.

3. **Commit and Push**:
   Commit your changes and push them to your fork:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe the changes you made"
   git push
   ```

   Alternatively, use VSCode's inbuilt Git source control pane `Ctrl+Shift+G` if you're unconfortable with a CLI

4. **Submit a Pull Request**:
   After pushing your changes, open a pull request from your fork to this repository (remember to reference the correct issue in your PR).

7. **Get Feedback**:
   Wait for a maintainer to review your pull request (PR) and provide feedback.

8. **Gain Bounty Points**:
   If everything is approved, your issue will be closed, and you'll gain bounty points on the leaderboard!
